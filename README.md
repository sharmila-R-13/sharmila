## Project Description

This project aims to develop a personalized product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform using machine learning algorithms. The recommendation system suggests products to users based on their past interactions, purchase history, and preferences, enhancing the user experience and boosting sales.

---

## Objectives

### Problem
Users struggle to find relevant products, leading to a suboptimal shopping experience and potential sales loss.

### Project Goals
- Enhance user engagement.
- Boost conversion rates by delivering personalized product recommendations.
- Improve click-through rates, session durations, purchase frequency, and user satisfaction scores.

---

## Design and Implementation

### Ideation and Design Thinking Process
- Explored diverse recommendation algorithms (collaborative, content-based, hybrid).
- Designed an intuitive user interface with personalized homepages, complementary product suggestions, and user profiles.
- Implemented feedback mechanisms (e.g., thumbs up/down, comments, surveys, purchase history reviews) to optimize recommendations and enhance the user experience.

### Predictive Use Cases
- Predicted Customer Product Preferences in E-commerce.
- Utilized a dataset containing customer profiles, historical purchase data, product attributes, and interactions.

### Model Training
- Employed collaborative filtering or hybrid recommendation approaches using IBM Cloud Watson Studio.

### Model Deployment
- Deployed the trained recommendation model using IBM Cloud Watson Studio's deployment capabilities.
- Integrated the model into the e-commerce platform's backend for real-time product recommendations.
